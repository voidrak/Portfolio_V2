        I'm Nahom Abraham, a web developer and software engineering student at
        Kombolcha Institute of Technology. My passion for web development began
        in 2022, and I've been designing and developing websites ever since.
        Coding, for me, is more than just a tool â€“ it's a way to express myself.
        Since my first HTML "Hello World" program, I've felt like I've found my
        comfort zone. The thrill of creating something new solidified this.
        Beyond code, I enjoy music and football.
