<p id="description">This portfolio is a showcase of my skills in modern web development. It's built with React JS providing a performant and adaptable foundation. Tailwind CSS keeps the styling efficient and consistent. For captivating animations I've utilized Framer Motion and for precise control over specific elements GSAP is employed</p>
